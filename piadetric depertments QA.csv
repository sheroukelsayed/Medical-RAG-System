Brain Tumors,"A 9-year-old boy presents to the emergency department with emesis and headache of 3
weeks’ duration. MRI reveals a large heterogeneous mass in the cerebellum. He undergoes a
resection, and the pathology is most consistent with a classic medulloblastoma.
Which of the following findings would classify the patient as a high-risk medulloblastoma?
A. Elevated serum and CSF AFP and beta-HCG tumor markers
B. WNT subgrouping on molecular classification
C. A presurgical spine MRI that reveals bulky tumor in the spine
D. A postoperative brain MRI with no signs of residual tumor",C. A presurgical spine MRI that reveals bulky tumor in the spine,"Although molecular classification is slowly becoming part of prognostication and treatment
paradigms for medulloblastoma, the most accepted and studied risk groups are standard- and high-risk medulloblastoma. WNT subgrouping seems to portend an improved survival, and by itself does not make a patient high-risk. In addition to histology (classic, desmoplastic, extremely nodular, and anaplastic/large cell), the other characteristics that define risk groups are age, amount of residual disease, and metastases. Both lumbar CSF cytology and a full spine MRI are necessary to evaluate for metastatic disease. Spinal MRI should be done preoperatively or 10 to 14 days postoperatively to avoid postoperative changes that can make interpretation difficult.
Lumbar CSF cytology also should be done 10 to 14 days postoperatively. Metastatic disease in the spine would increase the patient’s risk level to high and change treatment. Medulloblastoma metastases typically are confined to the brain and spine. Medulloblastoma does not secrete tumor markers.",100mcq's
Brain Tumors,"A 6-year-old boy is noted to have worsening visual acuity on serial eye exams. Recent MRI
of his brain and orbits reveals an optic chiasm mass, most consistent with an optic pathway
glioma. Upon further examination, the physician notes axillary freckling and numerous
“spots” on the patient’s skin.
This patient most likely has a which of the following genetic disorders?
A. Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1)
B. Li Fraumeni syndrome
C. Tuberous sclerosis
D. Cystic Fibrosis",A. Neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF1),"Children with neurofibromatosis type-1 (NF-1) have about a 15% to 20% risk of developing lowgrade gliomas (LGG), most commonly in the optic pathway. They also have a variety of other abnormalities such as axillary freckling and café-au-lait spots. Li Fraumeni syndrome is associated with p53 mutations and high-grade tumors, like high-grade gliomas and sarcomas.
The characteristic brain tumor in tuberous sclerosis is a subependymal giant cell astrocytom (SEGA). Patients with cystic fibrosis are not at increased risk of CNS tumors. LGGs in patients
with NF1 are often indolent and do not necessitate any therapy at all. However, most would
agree that when visual acuity is affected by the tumor, treatment is indicated to prevent further vision decline and possibly improve vision in some patients. The best known current therapy is LGG chemotherapy. Common first-line LGG chemotherapies are combinations of carboplatin/vincristine, vinblastine alone, or a combination of thioguanine, procarbazine,
lomustine (CCNU), and vincristine (TPCV). TPCV often is avoided for patients with NF-1
because of the risks of secondary malignancy with alkylator use. Radiotherapy is avoided for children with NF-1 because of the high risk of secondary malignancy.",100mcq's
Brain Tumors,"An 8-year-old boy undergoes a resection of a tumor in the right cerebrum next to the lateral
ventricle (supratentorial). The pathologist feels the histology is most consistent with an
ependymoma. The tumor is sent for advanced molecular and genetic testing. Which of the
following findings would further support a diagnosis of ependymoma?
A. BRAFKIAA1549 fusion
B. BRAFV600E mutation
C. RELA fusion
D. H3K27M mutation",C. RELA fusion,"Both A and B (the BRAF abnormalities) are most commonly seen in glial tumors, specifically in
low-grade glioma. BRAFKIAA1549 fusion is seen in 60% to 80% of classic pilocytic
astrocytoma, the most common pediatric low-grade glioma. The BRAFV600E mutation is most
commonly seen in low-grade glioma but has also been described in about 8% to 10% of highgrade
glioma. Supratentorial ependymomas seemingly are divided by two major molecular
aberrations, including the C11orf95-RELA fusion and the YAP1 fusion. The RELA fusion is
much more common and seems to portend a worse prognosis, whereas the YAP1 fusion is quite
rare and most often seen in infants with an improved survival outcome. The H3K27M mutation
is a defining characteristic of diffuse midline gliomas, such as diffuse intrinsic pontine glioma
(DIPG).",100mcq's
Brain Tumors,"A 5-year-old boy presents with a 3-week history of his right eye “not moving to the right
side.” The remainder of his neurologic exam is normal with the exception of a weak gag.
MRI of the brain reveals a diffusely infiltrative mass in the pons.
If this patient were to undergo a stereotactic biopsy, what would be the most likely
molecular finding?
A. BRAFKIAA1549 fusion
B. Trisomy 21
C. H3 K27M mutation
D. RELA fusion",C. H3 K27M mutation,"Advances over the last decade have revealed a characteristic histone mutation in DIPG and other
midline high-grade gliomas in H3 K27M. The World Health Organization now classifies midline
tumors harboring this abnormality as diffuse midline gliomas (DMG), which portend a worse
prognosis than other high-grade gliomas. BRAFKIAA1549 fusion is commonly seen in lowgrade
glioma. Trisomy 21 is not commonly seen in brain tumors. RELA fusion is a common
finding in supratentorial ependymoma.",100mcq's

 Acute Lymphoblastic Leukemia,"Of the variables listed below, what is the most important factor for survival after relapse of
acute lymphoblastic leukemia?
A. Time to marrow relapse since initial diagnosis
B. Sex
C. Central nervous system involvement at relapse
D. Response to induction therapy during initial diagnosis
E. Percent of marrow blasts at the time of relapse",A. Time to marrow relapse since initial diagnosis,"The most important prognostic factor for survival after relapse is the time to relapse after initial
diagnosis, especially for those with marrow involvement. Although outcomes after relapse may
be shifting with new therapies that have become available for children and adolescents and
young adults who experience relapse, historic outcomes for relapse prior to the introduction of
these newer therapies (blinatumomab, inotuzumab, and CAR-T cells) were remarkably constant
across multiple consortia. For example, survival for patients who relapse less than 18 months
from initial diagnosis is the worst, with most 3-year survival rates less than 20%. Neither sex nor
central nervous system involvement worsen the prognosis for marrow relapse. In addition,
percent marrow blasts at the time of relapse has no significance, nor does the response rate of the
patient at initial diagnosis, although measurable residual disease at end induction for B-acute
lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and end consolidation for T-ALL is generally considered to be
the most important prognostic variable for ultimate relapse.",100mcq's

 Stem Cell Transplantation,"When should autologous hematopoietic stem cell transplantation be used, and what are the
common cancers it is used for?
A. It should be used when high dose therapy is needed to maximize response. Most common
cancers it is used for include lymphoma, late relapse of acute lymphoblastic leukemia,
neuroblastoma, and Ewing sarcoma.
B. It should be used any time this approach can provide a meaningful survival benefit over
chemotherapy. Most common cancers it is used for include neuroblastoma, responsive
brain tumors in young children to avoid/minimize early radiation therapy, and relapsed
lymphoma.
C. It should be used for tumors in which a graft-versus-tumor effect does not occur. Most
common cancers include neuroblastoma, lymphoma, selected brain tumors,
rhabdomyosarcoma, and Ewing sarcoma with lung metastases.
D. It should be used to avoid extensive treatment with chemotherapy and to shorten
treatment. Most common cancers include neuroblastoma, relapsed Wilms’ tumor, and
selected brain tumors.
E. It should be used to avoid complications of graft-versus-host disease. Most common
cancers include neuroblastoma, selected brain tumors, and relapsed lymphoma.","B. It should be used any time this approach can provide a meaningful survival benefit over
chemotherapy. Most common cancers it is used for include neuroblastoma, responsive
brain tumors in young children to avoid/minimize early radiation therapy, and relapsed
lymphoma.","Autologous transplantation, often called high-dose chemotherapy with stem cell rescue, is an
approach that is limited to tumors with a dose-response curve that allows cure to be achieved
after receiving one or more rounds of intensive therapy. It should not be limited to tumors in
which a graft-versus-tumor effect (GVT) from an allogeneic donor does not occur, but for any
disease for which it can be shown to have a beneficial effect on survival above standard
chemotherapy. There are rare situations in which a patient with a disease like acute myeloid
leukemia (AML), which has a great GVT effect and usually requires an allogeneic hematopoietic
stem cell transplant (HSCT), can benefit from autologous bone marrow transplant (BMT) (eg,
lower risk disease that relapses late, has a molecular marker, and patients achieve a very deep
remission—acute promyelocytic leukemia and t(8:21) AML). Some tumors have a great
response to high-dose chemotherapy but can be cured equally well with intensive chemotherapy
(eg, relapsed Wilms’ tumor). Whether autologous HSCT should be used in this setting for
Wilms’ tumor is controversial, and patient/center preference is used. Use of this approach to
avoid graft-versus-host disease is highly desirable; however, in many cancer types, GVT is vital
and needed for success (high risk acute lymphoblastic leukemia and AML). The most common
tumor types benefitting from autologous HSCT include neuroblastoma, responsive brain tumors
(several tumor types in children younger than 3 years to avoid, postpone, or minimize radiation
therapy, relapsed responsive medulloblastoma), and relapsed lymphoma that is responsive to
chemotherapy. There has been benefit shown in other diseases, as well (eg, relapsed germ cell
47
tumors, disseminated retinoblastoma). With this explanation in mind, option B is the correct
answer.",100mcq's
Stem Cell Transplantation,"Which of the following statements about myeloablative, myeloablative but reduced toxicity,
reduced intensity, and non-myeloablative approaches is not correct?
A. Myeloblative approaches are needed for high-risk malignancies to maximize depth of
remission and decrease the likelihood of relapse.
B. Reduced intensity regimens can be successfully used for most nonmalignant disorders to
minimize risk of late effects.
C. Reduced intensity regimens can markedly decrease the risk of transplant-related mortality
in patients who have underlying significant comorbidities but at the cost of more relapse
and possibly more graft-versus-host disease.
D. Non-myeloablative regimens are used for the very highest risk patients to minimize
toxicity and for certain diseases such as aplastic anemia.
E. Myeloablative reduced toxicity approaches are often needed to decrease graft rejection
and maximize chimerism in certain non-malignant disorders.","Reduced intensity regimens can be successfully used for most nonmalignant disorders to
minimize risk of late effects.","Myeloablative regimens are used to both maximize depth of remission and to minimize the risk
of rejection. This has been shown to reduce relapse in disorders such as high-risk acute myeloid
leukemia and acute lymphoblastic leukemia, where these approaches are standard; hence, answer
A is true. Although reduced intensity regimens can be successfully used in some nonmalignant
disorders, many disorders cannot be treated as effectively with these approaches because of
higher risks of partial chimerism or rejection. In these disorders, reduced-toxicity approaches are
best. With this in mind, answer B is the correct answer (the only statement that is incorrect) and
answer E is true. A very important use of reduced intensity conditioning (RI or RIC) regimens is
in patients who have major comorbidities, such as decreased lung or heart function, or partially
controlled fungal infections. Although transplant-related mortality (TRM) decreases with these
approaches, relapse increases, and the need to use peripheral blood stem cells for the success of
these approaches results in more graft-versus-host disease. The trade-off of sacrificing intensity
for graft-versus-leukemia effect can cure many patients who do not have good alternatives;
however, they need to be in a good remission (minimal residual disease–negative, preferably) to
have a reasonable chance of success. For the sickest patients, non-myeloablative approaches
offer an alternative and can cure a number of patients with little toxicity (although with higher
relapse). Severe aplastic anemia treatment regimens are non-myeloablative and generally result
in few if any late effects and normal fertility. With this in mind, C and D are true.",100mcq's
 Stem Cell Transplantation,"A 3-year-old boy with X-linked chronic granulomatosis disease is day +25 after
haploidentical bone marrow transplant (father donor) using posttransplant cyclophosphamide
as graft-versus-host disease (GVHD) prophylaxis. He engrafted on day +16 and was
preparing for discharge when cytomegalovirus (CMV) was noted to be positive on PCR, and
he developed a fever and mild rash. His counts have fallen to a WBC of 0.1 and he remains
transfusion dependent. What diagnostic evaluations/treatments should you pursue?
A. Rule out infection by sending blood cultures, start broad spectrum antibiotics, and obtain
other diagnostic workup as appropriate. Consider skin biopsy and treat with steroids for
likely acute GVHD (aGHVD).
B. Initiate an infectious workup and treat with broad-spectrum antibiotics. Consult with the
PICU team because the low blood counts are likely a preseptic presentation.
C. Test for possible rejection with rapid FISH chimerism and consider withdrawal of
immune suppression if donor chimerism is low.
D. Send blood cultures, start antibiotics, and treat his CMV with foscarnet. Send rapid
chimerism by STR to assess for possible rejection. If donor chimerism is low or absent,
work on obtaining an alternative donor for a second procedure.
E. Start steroids to treat aGVHD and give supportive care with granulocyte colony
stimulating factor.","D. Send blood cultures, start antibiotics, and treat his CMV with foscarnet. Send rapid
chimerism by STR to assess for possible rejection. If donor chimerism is low or absent,
work on obtaining an alternative donor for a second procedure.","This patient is at high risk for rejection because he is undergoing bone marrow transplantation
(BMT) for a nonmalignant condition that is often associated with excessive inflammation, and he
has received a haploidentical procedure. Suspicion for rejection should be high. This patient also
initially showed count recovery but later developed a fever, rash, and low counts, a classic
presentation of acute rejection. Of note, however, infection or graft-versus-host disease (GVHD)
could also cause a picture similar to this, so this must be approached carefully. Option A includes
many things that should be done, but with counts falling to nearly 0, GVHD is less likely, and
there is no mention of assessing for graft failure. Option B focuses on infection and possible
sepsis. Although overwhelming sepsis could present like this, other signs such as hypotension
would likely be present. Option C is not correct because this boy received a transplant from his
father, so FISH chimerism, which relies on sex differences between donor and recipient, cannot
be performed. Option D is correct—a rule-out for bacteria must be performed with initiation of
antibiotics even though all of these symptoms (fever, rash, low counts) can be explained by acute
rejection. The fever could also be associated with the cytomegalovirus (CMV) reactivation, and
if this proves to be acute rejection, the rejection was likely triggered by the CMV reactivation.
When rejection is proven by noting absent donor chimerism, full control of the infection
followed by a salvage hematopoietic stem cell transplant (HSCT) procedure to restore
engraftment should be done as soon as possible. Option E focuses only on acute GVHD, which is
not likely, and growth factors such as granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) do not
improve counts in the face of acute rejection.",100mcq's

The National Wilms Tumor Study Group (NWTS)/Children’s Oncology Group (COG)
recommends upfront nephrectomy over biopsy for all patients (except bilateral or bilaterally
predisposed) when feasible. Although the patient has pulmonary metastases, and her disease is
therefore designated as overall stage IV, the local stage (kidney) may still be stage I or II. There
is no evidence of tumor thrombus (extending to above the level of the hepatic veins), and the
tumor is below the size at which risk of intraoperative rupture is increased (12-14 cm). If the
diagnosis of this patient is FHWT, with upfront nephrectomy, depending upon intraoperative
findings and lymph node status, this patient may be spared flank radiation if stage I or II for
nephrectomy.
Option A is incorrect. Although option A can be an appropriate approach in some presentations
of renal tumors, following the NWTS/COG approach, upfront biopsy is not recommended when
nephrectomy is possible. Option C is incorrect. Fine-needle aspirations are always discouraged
for tissue diagnosis in renal tumors because they are inadequate for obtaining important tumor
biology and often inadequate for histologic diagnosis. Option D is incorrect. This approach could
be appropriate according to treatment guidelines of The International Society of Paediatric
Oncology (SIOP), which would recommend initiation of chemotherapy with vincristine,actinomycin, and doxorubicin; however, these drugs would only be appropriate if the diagnosis

D. Both parents carry cis deletions in the alpha globin gene cluster.",A. The mother and father are both silent carriers and each passed a deleted alpha globin,"Alpha globin deletions causing alpha thalassemia minor may be inherited in the cis (deletion on

detected at or near birth. If the offspring inherits both parental alleles with one missing alpha
globin gene, the child will still inherit two functioning alpha globin, which is consistent with

Thrombin cleaves Factor VIII from vWF and activates, but vWF circulates as an active protein,
although it stays in a dormant form until it binds to subendothelial collagen. vWF is stored in
Weibel-Palade bodies but not Factor VIII, so D is incorrect, and a deficiency of vWF without a
concomitant reduction in Factor VIII does not prolong the PTT. A severe enough deficiency,

prothrombotic steps (activation of Factor VIII to Factor VIIIa, cleaving fibrinogen to fibrin,

plays a key role in limiting the coagulation reaction to the site of endothelial disruption. It does
so by binding to thrombomodulin, which is a surface protein that is present on intact endothelial
cells (ie, ones from whom bleeding is not occurring). This makes option D the correct answer.
Although proteins C and S are key regulators of more thrombin generation, their activation is
driven by the binding of thrombin to thrombomodulin—they do not in and of themselves alter
the function of thrombin, although their activity ultimately does reduce further thrombin
generation. Antithrombin does inhibit thrombin by directly binding to it and forming thrombinantithrombin
complexes, which nullify the activity of each, but antithrombin does not alter

absence of von Willebrand factor, the half-life of infused factor VIII is extremely low. Asking
otorhinolaryngology to help is not out of the question, but it will not solve the underlying
problem, which is absence of von Willebrand factor. She is unlikely to have an inhibitor, because
she had some response to the infused factor VIII, and desmopressin, although helpful in type 1

stopped when he develops a temperature of 40 °C with chills and rigors. A transfusion
reaction work-up is most likely to reveal what findings?
A. Spherocytes on peripheral blood smear
B. Gram-negative Bacillus on gram stain of remaining RBC unit
C. Chest x-ray with bilateral pulmonary infiltrates that are new compared to an x-ray done

D. DAT positive for C3
E. Antibody screen positive for anti-Jka antibodies",D. DAT positive for C3,"The combination of fever, anxiety, and back pain within the first 10 to 15 minutes of a red blood
cell transfusion is most consistent with an acute hemolytic transfusion reaction due to ABO
incompatibility. Patients who have type B blood will have anti-A antibodies that will fix
complement, leading to rapid intravascular hemolysis. Therefore, he will have a DAT positive
for C3 (complement). Answer A describes IgG-mediated extravascular hemolysis that can either
be due to autoimmune hemolytic anemia or delayed hemolytic transfusion reaction, which is
typically 1 to 28 days after transfusion. Spherocytes are seen with a DHTR, not an ABOincompatible
AHTR. Answer B describes a septic transfusion reaction, which can present with
fever but is more likely to also present with hypotension rather than anxiety or flank pain.
Answer C describes the x-ray findings of a patient with transfusion-related acute lung injury

E. Start oral therapy with oxymetholone.",D. Send a skin fibroblast culture for Fanconi anemia testing.,"A family history of a sibling with aplastic anemia and a cousin with pediatric acute myeloid
leukemia raises the possibility of an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) even in
the absence of other clinical stigmata such as congenital anomalies. The significant transplantrelated
toxicity experienced by the sibling is suggestive of an IBMFS such as Fanconi anemia. A
reduced-intensity transplant conditioning regimen would be indicated for a patient with Fanconi
anemia. Peripheral blood tests for Fanconi anemia may be negative if the lymphocytes have
reverted to wild type (somatic mosaicism). The gold standard to establish the diagnosis of
Fanconi anemia or conclusively exclude it in this situation is to test skin fibroblasts. There is no
advantage to testing the bone marrow aspirate for chromosomal breakage because somatic
mosaicism also has been reported in the hematopoietic cells, and chromosomal breakage assays
have not been standardized for marrow samples. Patients with Fanconi anemia typically fail to
respond to anti-human thymocyte globulin and cyclosporine therapy for aplastic anemia.
Oxymetholone is commonly used to support blood counts in Fanconi anemia patients but should
not be considered until a diagnosis is confirmed and transplant options considered.",100mcq's

Blackfan anemia (DBA) and transient erythroblastopenia of childhood (TEC). DBA, which is
often associated with an elevated erythrocyte adenosine deaminase level, typically presents in
infancy with macrocytic red cell aplasia but may present in adulthood with normalization of the
mean corpuscular volume (MCV) for age. TEC typically presents at an older age than DBA, and
the MCV is typically normal. In an asymptomatic patient, transfusion may be deferred at this
hemoglobin level. Thus, this patient is most likely to have TEC, and close clinical observation of
her blood counts (and clinical status) for the need for a transfusion is the indicated management.
An eADA may help to clarify your thinking that this is TEC, but likely, by the time you have the
result, blood counts will have recovered and it will be unnecessary. Close observation will still
be required. Erythropoietin levels are typically already high with red cell aplasia, and additional

genes listed are associated with an inherited bone marrow failure syndrome (IBMFS) with
neutropenia, the one associated with myeloid hyperplasia of the marrow is CXCR4, which is
mutated in myelokathexis/WHIM syndrome. In WHIM syndrome (neutropenia with warts,
hypogammaglobulinemia, infections, and myelokathexis), autosomal dominant mutations in
CXCR4 cause a gain of function defect that results in a limitation of down regulation after
stimulation. Granulocyte colony stimulating factor (G-CSF) ameliorates the neutropenia and
apoptosis as well as the hypogammaglobulinemia that accentuates the infections seen in the
disorder. While ELANE, which is mutated in many of the congenital neutropenia syndromes and
SBDS in Shwachman-Diamond syndrome, cause neutropenia and will respond to G-CSF, they
are not associated with warts or a hypercellular marrow unless malignant transformation has
occurred. Mitochondrial DNA mutations are seen in Pearson syndrome in association with
vacuolated marrow precursors and ringed sideroblasts (the later are absent here), usually in a
patient with a history of metabolic disturbances, exocrine pancreatic dysfunction, and
thrombocytopenia. The neutropenia of Pearson syndrome is not usually severe enough to require
G-CSF when the patient is otherwise well. GATA 2 mutations are associated with MonoMAC

platelet dysfunction by inhibiting the formation of thromboxane A2. NSAIDs reversibly block
COX, so the effect on platelet function is related to the half-life of the drug. Aspirin, on the other
hand, irreversibly inactivates cyclooxygenase (COX), and so will have an effect for the duration
of the platelet lifespan, approximately 7 to 9 days. Both of these drugs have an antiplatelet effect
through COX-1 inhibition. COX-2 inhibition is shown by NSAIDs and results in antiinflammatory
effects. Direct inhibition of adenosine diphosphate (ADP) is the mechanism of

A. Stage I
B. Stage II
C. Stage III
D. Stage IV",A. Stage I,"The Ann Arbor staging system takes into account that Hodgkin lymphoma typically spreads
along contiguous lymph nodes, and extranodal involvement usually results from direct extension
of nodal disease. Hematogenous spread does not usually occur until disease is very advanced.
The Ann Arbor Staging System
Stage I: A single node region (I) or single extranodal organ or site (IE)
Stage II: Two or more node regions on the same side of the diaphragm (II) or one node
region and localized extranodal site on the same side of the diaphragm (IIE)
Stage III: Node regions involved on both sides of the diaphragm (III) or with localized
extranodal site involved (IIIE) or spleen involvement (IIIS)
Stage IV: Diffuse or disseminated involvement of more than one extranodal site
Extranodal structures contiguous with sites of lymph node involvement are considered E-lesions
and include lung, pleural, pericardial, or chest wall infiltration by an adjacent nodal lesion.
Pleural and pericardial effusions alone are not considered E-lesions. Liver and bone marrow are
not E-lesions but are considered stage IV.
Substage classifications are based on defined clinical features and are used in risk stratification.
Substage A indicates asymptomatic disease. Substage B indicates the presence of B symptoms,
which include fever greater than 38 °C for 3 consecutive days, drenching night sweats, and
unexplained weight loss of at least 10% body weight over a 6-month period.

chemotherapy. Because dexamethasone cannot be given to patients with leukemia as an
antiemetic, and the patient is older than 6 months, the patient is on the correct regimen of a 5HT3
inhibitor (ondansetron) and a NK1 inhibitor (aprepitant). Chemotherapy, metabolic products,
drugs, and toxins stimulate nausea and vomiting through their effects on the chemoreceptor
trigger zone. Blocking 5HT3 and NK1 occurs at the level of the chemoreceptor trigger zone and
prevents further signaling to the vomiting center (receptors in the vomiting center being
histamine [H1], m-acetylcholine, and 5HT2). Medications that have antidopaminergic (D2)
activity such as olanzapine, haloperidol, and promethazine also work at the chemoreceptor
trigger zone. The vestibular system is mediated through histamine and m-acetylcholine. These
are relevant in children with motion sickness or labyrinth disorders. Medications that work at the

There are multiple classes of medications used to treat neuropathic pain, such as gabapentinoids

duloxetine), tricyclic antidepressants (TCAs; amitriptyline, nortriptyline), opioids (methadone),
and other agents like lidocaine and ketamine. As her QTc is near 500, methadone and
amitriptyline should be avoided because they could worsen the QTc prolongation. Sertraline is a
selective serotonin reuptake inhibitor (SSRI; antidepressant/antianxiolytic). SSRIs do not treat
neuropathic pain like the SNRIs (duloxetine or venlafaxine). Using more oxycodone will
probably cause more opioid-induced side effects and is not the best long-term management
strategy for neuropathic pain. In this setting, adding gabapentin three times daily, and titrating up

D. Safe, timely, effective, efficient, cutting-edge, and person-centered","A. Safe, timely, effective, efficient, equitable, and person-centered","In their landmark report Crossing the Quality Chasm, the Institute of Medicine outlined six
major domains of quality health care, which can be remembered using the mnemonic STEEP.
These are a good guide for teams to use in developing organizational and project-based aims.
• First, health care must be safe. This means much more than the ancient maxim, “first, do
no harm,” which makes it the individual caregiver’s responsibility to somehow try extra
hard to be more careful (a requirement modern human factors theory has shown to be
unproductive). Instead, the aim means that safety must be a property of the system. No
one should ever be harmed by health care again.
• Second, health care must be effective. It should match science, with neither underuse nor
overuse of the best available techniques—every elderly heart patient who would benefit
from beta-blockers should get them, and no child with a simple ear infection should get
advanced antibiotics.
• Third, health care should be patient-centered. The individual patient’s culture, social
context, and specific needs deserve respect, and the patient should play an active role in
making decisions about his or her own care. That concept is especially vital today, as
more people require chronic rather than acute care.
• Fourth, care should be timely. Unintended waiting that doesn’t provide information or
time to heal is a system defect. Prompt attention benefits both the patient and the
caregiver.
• Fifth, the healthcare system should be efficient, constantly seeking to reduce the waste—
hence the cost—of supplies, equipment, space, capital, ideas, time, and opportunities.
• Sixth, health care should be equitable. Race, ethnicity, gender, and income should not
prevent anyone in the world from receiving high-quality care. We need advances in
healthcare delivery to match the advances in medical science so the benefits of that
science may reach everyone equally.",100mcq's

their intuition, quality improvement activities do not require IRB review but research projects
must be submitted to the IRB. Which of the following is NOT a relevant consideration in
determining whether the project is research or quality improvement?
A. The aim to create new knowledge for the individual institution versus discovering new
and generalizable knowledge
B. The chosen methodology which will include repeated Plan-Do-Study-Act cycles
C. The intent to publish the results in a peer reviewed hematology journal
D. The efforts to hold biases/confounders stable over time, rather than control for them with,
for example, randomization",C. The intent to publish the results in a peer reviewed hematology journal,"The distinction between quality improvement projects and traditional research projects can be a
confusing one but, over time, the relevant distinctions between these two activities have become
clearer. The first pertains to intent. Researchers intend to discover new knowledge that would be
generalizable to others whereas quality improvement aims more to create new knowledge that
would be applied to local practices and local systems of care. Second, research often involves a
single experiment or trial, often done over a large amount of time, controlling for as many
biases/confounders as possible. In quality improvement, the methodology involves short,
repeated cycles of intervention, each time layering on something new, while keeping
biases/confounders otherwise stable, even if not controlled. In research we collect as much data
as possible from this single experiment while in quality improvement we collect just enough data
to allow us to plan the next cycle. Individuals unsure of whether their project is best
characterized as research vs. quality improvement are encouraged to seek consultation from their
local IRB.",100mcq's

lower frequencies in the audible range are affected. Cisplatin is more ototoxic than carboplatin.

D. His risk for testosterone deficiency is greater than his risk for infertility.
E. Prepubertal status at diagnosis is protective from gonadal injury in males.",A. A semen analysis at this point would provide accurate information about future fertility.,"Explanation
Adolescents and young adults are often concerned about their risk for future infertility. Risk for
gonadotoxicity and fertility preservation options differ for males and females. Males are more
sensitive to gonadotoxic exposures and have a higher risk of infertility compared to females with
equivalent treatment. The Leydig cells that secrete testosterone are fairly resistant to gonadotoxic
injury; therefore, males are often able to produce normal levels of testosterone even if they have
Sertoli/germ cell damage leading to infertility. In females, the stromal and germ cells are equally
affected by therapy; therefore, after girls receive highly gonadotoxic therapy, they are more
likely to need hormone replacement to proceed through puberty or maintain menstrual cycles.
Prepubertal status is protective from gonadal injury in females; however, this is not true in males.
In males, gonadal recovery after therapy can take up to 5 years. After recovery, gonadal function
is stable with aging. On the other hand, females may have recovery after treatment leading to a
reproductive window prior to premature menopause. A semen analysis is the best method for
fertility evaluation in males and would be appropriate to pursue at this time if the patient is
interested. Semen cryopreservation is only possible in postpubertal males. Prepubertal males can
undergo testicular tissue cryopreservation; however, it is still considered experimental.",100mcq's
